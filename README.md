# Final_Project_ESCI
This project investigates the seasonal evolution of snowpack and surface conditions at Hubbard Brook using Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data and in-situ meteorological observations.
# Why this study?
Seasonal snow plays a critical role in the hydrologic cycle by controlling water storage, runoff timing, soil freeze–thaw processes, and land–atmosphere energy exchange. However, accurate characterization of snowpack conditions remains challenging because ground-based measurements require substantial manual effort, are spatially sparse, and often lack consistent temporal resolution. These limitations make it difficult to monitor snow depth, density, and melt transitions across heterogeneous landscapes.

Satellite remote sensing provides an opportunity to overcome these constraints by offering repeated, spatially consistent observations across large areas. In particular, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is well suited for snow hydrology because SAR backscatter is sensitive to snow metamorphism, liquid water content, and melt–freeze cycles, and is unaffected by cloud cover or daylight constraints. Understanding how SAR responds to seasonal snow dynamics is also increasingly important in the context of the newly launched NASA–ISRO SAR mission (NISAR). Interpreting NISAR snow signals will require a strong foundation in the behavior of existing C-band SAR.

Most studies focus on western or alpine snowpacks, which are generally deeper, drier, and more consistent. In contrast, snowpacks in the northeastern U.S. are much thinner, wetter, and highly transient, leading to different microwave scattering behavior that remains poorly understood. This project aims to help close that gap by examining how Sentinel-1 backscatter responds to the unique snow conditions of the Northeast.

# study area

Hubbard Brook (NH) – 7,800-acre long-term research site located in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, USA. Annual precipitation averages about 1,400 millimeters (55 in), with one-third as snow.


The main objective is to examine how backscatter (VV/VH polarization) responds to seasonal snow accumulation, melt transitions, and related meteorological variability such as air temperature and precipitation.


## Objectives  
1.Map the spatial distribution of Sentinel-1 backscatter (VV/VH).  
2.Compare early-winter, mid-winter, and melt-season backscatter patterns changes in temperature and precipitation.  
3.Explain winter differences in snowpack conditions.  

(Validation)  
Use in-situ snow depth measurements to evaluate Sentinel-1 backscatter sensitivity.
