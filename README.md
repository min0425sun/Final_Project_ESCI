# Final_Project_ESCI
This project investigates the seasonal evolution of snowpack and surface conditions at Kingman Farm (Durham, NH) using Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data and in-situ meteorological observations.
# Why this study?
Seasonal snow plays a critical role in the hydrologic cycle by controlling water storage, runoff timing, soil freeze–thaw processes, and land–atmosphere energy exchange. However, accurate characterization of snowpack conditions remains challenging because ground-based measurements require substantial manual effort, are spatially sparse, and often lack consistent temporal resolution. These limitations make it difficult to monitor snow depth, density, and melt transitions across heterogeneous landscapes.

Satellite remote sensing provides an opportunity to overcome these constraints by offering repeated, spatially consistent observations across large areas. In particular, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is well suited for snow hydrology because SAR backscatter is sensitive to snow metamorphism, liquid water content, and melt–freeze cycles, and is unaffected by cloud cover or daylight constraints. Understanding how SAR responds to seasonal snow dynamics is also increasingly important in the context of the newly launched NASA–ISRO SAR mission (NISAR). Interpreting NISAR snow signals will require a strong foundation in the behavior of existing C-band SAR.

Most studies focus on western or alpine snowpacks, which are generally deeper, drier, and more consistent. In contrast, snowpacks in the northeastern U.S. are much thinner, wetter, and highly transient, leading to different microwave scattering behavior that remains poorly understood. This project aims to help close that gap by examining how Sentinel-1 backscatter responds to the unique snow conditions of the Northeast.

# Two study areas are considered:

Kingman Farm (Durham, NH) – used for spatial SAR mapping, surface condition analysis, and interpretation of winter-to-winter variability.
Hubbard Brook (NH) – used as the primary source of public in-situ snow depth data for validating temporal SAR sensitivity.

*Note;
Field measurements collected at Kingman Farm cannot be publicly distributed due to data-access restrictions, so all validation (Sentinel-1 and in situ scatter plot) is performed using the public Hubbard Brook snow dataset.

The main objective is to examine how backscatter (VV/VH polarization) responds to seasonal snow accumulation, melt transitions, and related meteorological variability such as air temperature and precipitation.


## Objectives
Kingman Farm (Spatial Analysis)
1.Map the spatial distribution of Sentinel-1 backscatter (VV/VH) across Kingman Farm.
2.Compare early-winter, mid-winter, and melt-season backscatter patterns changes in temperature and precipitation.
3. Explain winter differences in snowpack conditions.

Hubbard Brook (Validation)
Use open in-situ snow depth measurements (2023–2025) to evaluate Sentinel-1 backscatter sensitivity.

1.Assess whether Sentinel-1 backscatter responds to changes in underlying snowpack depth or structure.
2. Time-series scatterplots, correlations.
