# Final_Project_ESCI
This project investigates the seasonal evolution of snowpack and surface conditions at Kingman Farm (Durham, NH) using Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data and in-situ meteorological observations.  
The main objective is to examine how backscatter (VV/VH polarization) responds to seasonal snow accumulation, melt transitions, and related meteorological variability such as air temperature and precipitation.

The work is effort to link active microwave remote sensing with field-based snow hydrology and evaluate its potential for monitoring snow wetness, snow density.

## Objectives
1. Analyze the temporal evolution of Sentinel-1 backscatter (Path 62, ascending) during the winters of 2023–24 and 2024–25.  
2. Compare the response of VV and VH polarizations to changes in temperature and precipitation.  
3. Visualize spatial variability of SAR backscatter across Kingman Farm through mapping and statistical comparison.  
4. Explain winter differences in snowpack conditions.
